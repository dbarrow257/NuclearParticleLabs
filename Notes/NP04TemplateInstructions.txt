The "runD_XXXXXX.dat" file needs to be copied to the same area in which the NP04Template_MT2022_ForStudents.ipynb (Juypter notebook file) exists

On this machine, opening Jupyter notebook is a little different.


To open the Jupyter notebook, "Windows Start Menu > Anaconda 3 > Anaconda Powershell Prompt" on the this computer.
Type "H:" (without the "") then hit enter [then hitting "ls" will show the contents of the H drive. "cd" also works here to move directorys for those familiar with linux]
Locate the directory which has the Jupyter notebook in it
Type "jupyter notebook" and hit enter
 
This opens a terminal and about 30 seconds later Firefox(or Edge) opens into the standard Juypter notebook fashion.

Locate the NP04Template_MT2022_ForStudents.ipynb file and open.

Modify the run number (currently given in the top of the notebook i.e. FileName = 'runD_934002.dat') to the "runD_XXXXXX.dat" file which was copied to the "desk" computer.

Modify the dummy variables (10000, -10000) to optimise cuts to select the stopping muon events whilst minimising the uncorrelated and through-going events.
