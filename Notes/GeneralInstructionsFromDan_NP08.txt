Machines with Picoscope (SDK) software [PTLWT34 etc.] do not have Juypter installed, only the "desk" computers have Juypter notebooks

The "runD_XXXXXX.dat" file needs to be copied to the "desk" computers, which can be done through the home directory. For me, this is using "barrowd".

To open the Juypter notebook, "Windows Start Menu > Anaconda 3 > Juypter Notebook" on the "desk" computers. 
This opens a terminal and about 30 seconds later Firefox opens into the standard Juypter notebook fashion.

Locate the NP08Template_MT2022_ForStudents.ipynb file and open

Modify the run number (given in the top of the notebook which is currently FileName = 'runD_934002.dat') to the "runD_XXXXXX.dat" file which was copied to the "desk" computer

Modify the dummy variables to optimise cuts to select the stopping muon events whilst minimising the uncorrelated and through-going events
